    Palmiers from The Art of French Pastry
  </a>  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 I decided to make these classic french pastries for this week since they end up heart shaped, or at least vaguely heart shaped in my attempt. They are also my boyfriend's favorite (edit for 2020- he's my husband now). I used the recipe from the book The Art of French Pastry although a lot of the recipes I looked at for them are similar. It was my first time making puff pastry (although I've made laminated dough for croissants before) so there a lot of things I would improve on for next time, but so far not a bad first attempt, even if they did separate a bit while baking.
