 I have gotten some really incredible feedback about these, everyone at work is really happy with them. I did have a lot of difficulty with how sticky the dough was, but if I had read the comments on the recipe before trying to make it and followed their advice I probably would have had an easier time. They don't look very pretty, but they do taste good.
