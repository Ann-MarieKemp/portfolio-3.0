Mom's Yeast Rolls
  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 I make these rolls every year from my mom's recipe, they are super simple and delicious and buttery and I highly recommend them. 1 package yeast, 1 cup warm water, 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup shortening, 2 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder. Dissolve yeast in warm water, add sugar, salt and shortening. Sift flour and baking powder. Add to yeast mixture. Knead about 10-15 times, roll out and cut with a biscuit cutter. Butter both sides of biscuit and fold over. Let rise one hour. Bake at 400 degrees about 15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 12 biscuits. I usually double the recipe.
