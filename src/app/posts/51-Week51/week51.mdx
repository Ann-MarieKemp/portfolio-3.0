Lebkuchen
  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
  I decided to retry my grandmother's Lebkuchen recipe. Instead of doubling the recipe like I did the first time which resulted in a huge mass of cookies, I halved the recipe and ended up with an actual reasonable number of cookes. Apparently half of this recipe will make 3 dozen cookies. They turned out really well and I made the glaze thicker than the first time which I think is more how it is supposed to be. Definitely worth the retry!
