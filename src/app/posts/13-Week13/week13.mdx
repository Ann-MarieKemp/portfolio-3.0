  <p className="post-text">
 I have been wanting to try making these for a while.  The filling is a marshmallow creme filling and I made the marshmallow fluff for it from scratch from <a className="category-link baking" >this recipe</a>. They turned out better than I expected but I think next time I won't let the ganache set as long before I dip the cupcakes. It was too heavy and caused the marshmallow filling to run into the ganache. Hence the lighter appearance of some of the tops. I highly recommend this recipe.
