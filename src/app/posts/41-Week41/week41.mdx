Mille Feuille

  <p className="post-text">
 This week, I decided to try making mille-feuille for the first time. I apparently have a real problem being patient with these assembled desserts so it came out a bit of a mess, which is why I consider this one of the most difficult things to make. I also made a greek dessert called Ekmek that has a custard that is very similar to the pastry cream in the mille-feuille, although it has more eggs.
