   Brioche Recipe from The Professional Pastry Chef

  <p className="post-text">
   This was my first time making brioche, and as you can see they definitely deformed a lot in the oven, but I learned a whole lot about how to shape them better next time. I also didn't have enough brioche tins so I ended up using muffin pans to make the rest of them and that worked pretty well. I was really happy with how they ended up tasting, but they did get a little more brown on the bottom than they should have.
