 This is definitely one of the most messy cakes I've ever made. I was being impatient and not greasing my pans well enough so it came out a bit of a mess. Still tasted good though and I think I will try it again sometime when I actually have time to grease my pans correctly and freeze the layers. Also I would use gel color instead of liquid, but it's all I had around.
