  Brown Butter M&M Pretzel Cookies

  </a>  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 I found the recipe for these here. They turned out really well but if I had had one more egg in my kitchen I would have made two batches and made the cookies bigger because everybody at work really loved these. That being said althought the dough is really dry when you start rolling them into balls you can really pack a lot of M&Ms and pretzel pieces into each one even when they are this small. I also made the soft pretzel recipe from her site and it was super easy and turned out great. I will definitely be trying more of her recipes in the future.
