  <p className="post-text">
I stitched this hardanger Christmas box for my grandmother who shared my love of Christmas and liked to have a little bit of Christams in every room of her house year round. Hardanger is a type of Norwegian embroidery where you cut and remove threads from the cloth to help form the design.
