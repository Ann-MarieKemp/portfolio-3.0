 I used this <a className="category-link baking" href="(http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/4-ingredient-toffee/71be0a31-a3bb-4862-8086-39fcedb883ee)">recipe</a> for the toffee minus the nuts. They really spread out a lot when they are baking and I found them much easier to remove from the parchment paper after they were completely cool. They turned out really well and are really chewy.
