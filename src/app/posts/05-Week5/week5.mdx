   Gluten Free Chocolate Sheet Cake
  </a>  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
   I decided to modify one of my favorite recipes of my mother's to be gluten free and dairy free. I will post the normal recipes in this post and then add what I substituted for the dietary restrictions at the bottom.

The Chocolate Sheet Cake recipe is:

Blend: 2 Cups Flour 2 Cups Sugar 4 Tbsp Cocoa Powder

Boil: 1 Cup Water 1 Cup Butter/Margarine

Add to dry ingredients, mix well. Add 1/2 Cup Buttermilk or sour milk (I usually just add vinegar to regular milk), 1 tsp. Vanilla, 1 tsp. Baking Soda, 2 eggs (slightly beaten), 1/2 tsp. salt. Mix well, pour in greased Jelly Roll pan. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Icing: Blend 4 Tbsp Cocoa powder and 1 box (1lb) powdered sugar, add 1/3 Cup hot milk and 1/2 cup melted butter or margarine and mix well. Add 1 tsp Vanilla and beat well. Spread on hot cake.
  </p>

  <p className="post-text">In order to make this cake gluten free and dairy free, I substituted the flour with betty crocker gluten free flour mix and 1 tsp xantham gum. I substituted apple sauce for the eggs (1/4 cup per egg). I used earth balance for the margarine and I used soy milk instead of regular milk.</p>
