    Baked Sesame Seed Balls

 I found this recipe for a baked version of these treats here. Having never made them before I have no idea how they would taste fried, but these turned out really well. Fun fact I used to bake batches of these to bring to MSNBC host Ali Velshi when I worked on his show at Al Jazeera.
