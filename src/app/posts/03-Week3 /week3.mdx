  <p className="post-text">
   After a difficult evening of overfilling a couple of cake rings, I finally decided to make this Finnish dessert into less complicated cupcakes. You can find the recipe for the Tortes here. The cake is a really rich spice cake that is really wonderful, but I am not a fan of working with this particular icing as it sets up really fast.
