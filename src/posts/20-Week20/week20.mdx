 Cruffins</a>

  <p className="post-text">
 I saw where someone had posted a recipe for these using a pasta maker, but I wanted to try making them with real croissant dough. I used the croissant recipe from The Professional Pastry Chef book. Then I filled some of them with blackberry jam, some with lemon curd, some with whole blueberries and sugar, some with chocolate and the rest with a blueberry sugar mash. I burned the bottoms of the first batch since they really only need to bake about 10-15 minutes instead of the 25 for regular croissants. It was a learning experience but I am really happy with how they came out. The mailman at work actually just came back off his route to try and get another one, but they were already gone.
