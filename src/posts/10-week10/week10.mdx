  Baked Bean and Tomato Cupcakes

  <p className="post-text">
 I couldn't quite decide what to do for this week so I looked around the internet for some weird food combinations and I thought I would take a chance on these.  Unfortunately I didn't really find the end product to be to my liking, but I do think if I had left the tomato pieces out of the cupcakes they would have been quite good. The tomato cream cheese frosting is pretty good and the beans in the cake make a nicely textured spice cake kind of consistency. I just found the pieces of tomato to be a bit too much. Overall however, it was an interesting experiment completely outside of my baking comfort zone.
