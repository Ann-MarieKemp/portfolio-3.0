Strudel
  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 This strudel is another family recipe. I used the pastry dough recipe in the Professional Pastry Chef Book. For the strudel you just roll out a sheet of pastry dough (I used half of my pastry dough to make two strudels and the rest to make palmiers) and place apples and raisins with cinnamon sugar in the middle, brush with an egg wash, roll up jelly roll style and brush with an egg wash. Bake in oven on 350 for 35-40 minutes.
