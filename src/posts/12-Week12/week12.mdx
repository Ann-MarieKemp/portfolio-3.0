  Guinness Cupcakes with Bailey's Cream Cheese Frosting

  <p className="post-text">
 I've been waiting for a reason to try this recipe. These turned out wonderfully, the chocolate cake tastes amazing. If you haven't read <a className="category-link baking" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bethmullen/10-cupcakes-that-will-get-you-drunk-8wx3#.kbP08w9gb">this BuzzFeed List</a> you should check it out. This is the second cupcake recipe I've tried from it and they both turned out really wonderfully. I make the Apple Cider Whiskey ones pretty often.
