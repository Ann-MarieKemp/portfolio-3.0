  Lemon Cupcakes
  </a>  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 For these cupcakes I used the Triple Layer Lemon Cake Recipe from the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook. I filled the cupcakes with Lemon Curd and then topped them with <a className="category-link baking" href=" https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=wilton%20lemon%20buttercream">lemon buttercream </a>. I had made this as a cake before but I had never made it as cupcakes. The cupcakes came out more buttery than I had anticipated but they still ended up tasting pretty good. I was also too lazy to wait for the butter to come to room temp first though so that may have had something to do with it. The lemon in the lemon curd and frosting is just enough to counteract the buttery-ness of the cupcakes though so it worked out in the end.
