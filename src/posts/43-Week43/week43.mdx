Coconut Milk Flan
  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 I usually make this with evaporated milk instead of coconut milk, but it is good both ways. The coconut version is a bit less sweet. I am allergic to coconut so I can't make most coconut things but coconut milk is apparently not a trigger for me.
 This flan recipe is also the best flan you could ever have, recipe courtesy of Myrna Perez.

1/2 cup sugar- melt until golden and pour in bottom of pan. Combine 1 can sweetened condensed milk, 1 can coconut milk (or evaporated milk), 4oz cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 eggs in a blender. Pour in pan over hardened and cooled caramel and bake in a water bath for one hour at 325 degrees. Chill for a few hours, then turn onto plate and serve. It is so simple, but it is one of my favorite go to dessert recipes.
