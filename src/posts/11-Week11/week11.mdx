  Caramel Apple Dessert Pizza Filling
  </a>  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 I used a graham cracker pizza dough for the crust. I also used some homemade Dulce de Leche spread (sweetened condensed milk in the oven for 90 minutes) for sauce. The filling is from the recipe link (without the whiskey this time). Then on top I combined a cup of flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 stick butter, mixed it up with a pastry blender (It's part of a coffee cake recipe) and sprinkled it on top. I also sprinkled on some extra graham cracker crumbs. It turned out better than I expected for something I was making up as I went along. Make the cupcakes from the filling recipe if you want a great fall cupcake recipe.
