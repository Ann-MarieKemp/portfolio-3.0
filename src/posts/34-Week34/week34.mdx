  <p className="post-text">
 When I first bought The Professional Pastry Chef book there was a picture of this presentation of Cookie Crusted Profiteroles and I have wanted to make it ever since and this theme gave me the perfect excuse! There were a lot of parts, the profiteroles, the cookies on top of the profiteroles, the bavarian cream inside the profiteroles, the piping chocolate on the plate and the nougat sauce. In all it took me about seven hours. I was so happy with the result!
