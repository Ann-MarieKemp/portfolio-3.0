Lebkuchen

  <p className="post-text">
 This recipe came from my grandmother who got it from her grandmother. This week's lesson is don't double a recipe when you don't know how many it makes in the first place. So many cookies. The recipe didn't say how long to bake them for or on what temp because they were originally made in a cook stove and no one who has made them since apparently took the time to write it down. I guessed at 350 and then just eyeballed it from there. Now I just have to find someone to eat all of them.
