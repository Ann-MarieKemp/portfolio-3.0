 The first time I tried to make this a few years ago it was a dismal failure and there is still coffee all over my cookbook. This time was much more successful, I tried the "traditional presentation" from the book this time instead of the built version and was more patient and I think it turned out pretty well. I did have a hard time with the egg whites and ended up ruining two batches before I got the ladyfingers right, but I am pretty happy with the end result. I used the "traditional presentation" recipe from this book.
