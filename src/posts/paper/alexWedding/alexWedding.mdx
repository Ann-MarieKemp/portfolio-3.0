  <p className="main-page-header">Alex and Heather's Wedding Flowers</p>


  <p className="post-text">
 I made over 300 paper flowers, a wax paper backdrop, and a seating chart for my brother's wedding in 2016. The flowers were cut using patterns from Lia Griffith with a Cricut Explore Air cutting machine and then curled and glued together by hand.
