  <p className="post-text">
 I made the candy canes for these using the above recipe. That is why the candy pieces look more pink than red, I didn't add enough food coloring. The recipe for the cookies is here. My boyfriend suggested that I add salt on top after baking them because they were so sweet, so we did and baked them a few minutes longer. The result is a salty sweet cookie that is a little more balanced.
