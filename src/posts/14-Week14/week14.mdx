  Chocolate Doughnut Holes
  </a>  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 First time making any kind of doughnut. They turned out a little well done and rather dense, but they were apparently edible since they disappeared at work pretty quickly. I used the recipe above and glazed half of them with the vanilla glaze from the website and half of them with the chocolate.
