 Orange Hostess Cupcakes
  </p>

  <p className="post-text">
 A few weeks ago I made Hostess chocolate cupcakes for fillings week, so I though I would try the orange version for the copy cat treat. I used the same marshmallow filling and white icing that I made for those cupcakes. They turned out more yellow than orange because I didn't have any orange food coloring but they taste just like I remember them.
